# Undeployed changes

Work merged to `main` that is **not live yet**. Merging no longer deploys: a production
build runs only when the merge (or a later commit on `main`) has **`[deploy]`** in its
commit message (`scripts/netlify-ignore.sh`). When you deploy, run
[PRE_PUSH_CHECKLIST.md](PRE_PUSH_CHECKLIST.md), do the post-deploy steps below, then
empty this list.

- **On-device voices read far too fast** · PR #41 · On-device voice previews and read-aloud now follow Settings → Voice "Speaking speed"; the iOS plugin maps speed onto Apple's speech-rate scale with a gentle curve instead of the old linear one. Post-deploy: **rebuild the iOS app in Xcode** (the Swift plugin change only ships with a native build), then preview an iPhone voice at 1.0× and 1.5× in Settings → Voice. If the speed is still off, tune the `0.35` exponent in `avSpeechRate()` (`ios/App/App/LiveTtsPlugin.swift`).
